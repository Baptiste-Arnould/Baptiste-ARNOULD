#Presentation

ðŸ‘‹ As a Ph.D. student at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, I focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research, with particular expertise in simulating turbulent flows in aerodynamics. My primary research area is Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), a hybrid approach that combines RANS and LES techniques to model turbulent flow phenomena in aerodynamics.
